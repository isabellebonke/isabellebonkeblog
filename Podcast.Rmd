  Here is a link to the class website that I helped create in my Journalism Capstone Course at GWU. I created a politics and a social justice podcast. The politics podcast is called "Capital Current - Unpacking QAnon" and my social justice podcast is called "Capital Current - Unpacking Gentrification"
